### Homework 13
Building and running performance simulations in C#.


### Description
Development of a C# application to simulate and evaluate the performance of several sorting algorithms in a variety of scenarios and dataset sizes.


### Algorithms
Bubble Sort, Selection Sort and Quick Sort.


### Two approaches
Sequential C# + Parallel with C# Threads.


### About Implementation

1. Implemented Bubble Sort algorithm, Selection Sort algorithm and Quick Sort algorithm in C#.
2. Developed application that generates random data sets of various sizes and evaluates the sorting time for each algorithm using these data sets.
3. Measuring and comparing the sorting time of each algorithm for each scenario and dataset size.
4. Simulate different scenarios such as already sorted datasets, reverse sorted datasets, datasets with duplicate elements and evaluate the performance of algorithms in these scenarios.
